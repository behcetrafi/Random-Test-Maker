# Random Test Maker (Python)
 I prepared a test with 5 questions. And every time the program runs, the locations of all questions and their answers change randomly. In this way, a random exam is created for each person who solves the test and cheating is prevented.
 (I take these questions from Global AI Hub assesment tests.)
